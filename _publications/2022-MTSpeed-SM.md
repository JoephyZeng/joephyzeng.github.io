We establish an experimental platform to combine the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with an in situ observation of microstructure by differential interference contrast microscope (DInM). We carry out the experiment on a phase-transforming alloy AuCuZn that closely satisfies the cofactor conditions - the strongest crystallographic compatibility constraints between phases. We confirm that the phase formation events observed by DInM agree well with the heat exchange profile characterized by DSC. We also observe different morphology of twins evolves differently, depending on the twin spacing. Through the quantitative analysis of various morphological domains in the temporal space, we discover that the scaling law between the twin evolution time and the fineness is linear, by which the characteristic transformation time for single variant martensite can be determined for this compatible martensite alloy as 0.636s.
