We propose a new experimental mechanics method: dual beam-shear differential interference microscopy (DInM) for full-field surface deformation measurement. The method integrates the principles of differential interference contrast, photoelasticity, digital image correlation and the theories of continuum mechanics for a 4D quantification of the surface topography. Our first DInM prototype provides the lateral resolution of 787nm for up to 12% measurable out-of-plane strains. The resolution can be improved by using the shorter spectrum light and higher magnification objective lens. We use our system to characterize the buckling profile of Si microribbon on an elastomer substrate, which was verified by atomic force microscopy. We also demonstrate the stress-induced phase transformation in NiTi alloy by our system. The evolution of the surface topographies and the full-field deformation gradients are successfully captured and quantified. The dynamic measurement provides the information to calculate the relative transformation strains between phases of different symmetries. The establishment of dual beam-shear DInM opens a new avenue in the field of experimental meso/micromechanics.
